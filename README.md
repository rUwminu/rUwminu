## Hi there üëã

# About Me

üéì I Ray Goh, a Frontend & Fullstack Developer (current focus more on frontend development using react). I graduated with Bachelor Degree Software Enginnering in Dec 2020.

üìù At the start, I have zero to none interest to web development. But with the interest of programming and learn version control in my study day, I meet Github. That's the time I get amazed by the by the Github main page design, the animation and more, then I quickly get to know about web development and plan out the roadmap for it.

üé∏ Outside of tech, I like building and collect miniature plastic model like robot and planes as my hobby. And I also learn a bit on crafting and painting to further improve my plastic model realistic, and it also help with my web development color picking.
